# Staking and Yield Farming Smart Contract

This smart contract facilitates both staking and yield farming functionalities, allowing users to earn rewards on their cryptocurrency assets within a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

**Features:**

* **Staking:** Users can lock up their supported tokens to contribute to the platform's security and earn rewards.
* **Yield Farming:** Users can provide liquidity to designated pools, receiving a portion of the trading fees generated and potentially earning additional rewards in the form of protocol tokens.
* **Reward Distribution:** Rewards are distributed according to pre-defined rules based on factors like staking/farming duration and contribution level.
* **Flexible Staking:** Depending on the implementation, users might have the option to choose between staking periods with varying lockup times and potential rewards.
* **Security:** The smart contract is designed with security in mind, following best practices to minimize vulnerabilities. 

**Getting Started:**

### Installation and Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mishraji874/Staking-And-Yield-Farming-Smart-Contract.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Staking-And-Yield-Farming-Smart-Contract
3. Initialize Foundry and Forge:
    ```bash
    forge init
4. Create the ```.env``` file and paste the [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) api for the Sepolia Testnet and your Private Key from the Metamask.

5. Compile and deploy the smart contracts:

    If you want to deploy to the local network anvil then run this command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployStakingYieldFarm.s.sol --rpc-url {LOCAL_RPC_URL} --private-key {PRIVATE_KEY}
    ```
    If you want to deploy to the Sepolia testnet then run this command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployStakingYieldFarm.s.sol --rpc-url ${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY}
### Running Tests

Run the automated tests for the smart contract:

```bash
forge test
```

**Configuration:**

* Supported staking and farming tokens can be configured within the contract.
* Reward distribution parameters can be adjusted based on project requirements.

**Additional Notes:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be extended to include additional features like governance mechanisms or support for various DeFi protocols.
* Refer to the `StakingYieldFarming.sol` and `StakingYieldFarmingTest.t.sol` files for detailed contract logic and test cases.
* Carefully evaluate the risks associated with staking and yield farming before participating.

**Security Considerations:**

* Smart contract audits by reputable security firms are highly recommended.
* Stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and best practices in DeFi smart contract development.
